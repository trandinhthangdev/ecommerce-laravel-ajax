	The former White House official confirmed there was an effort to limit access to Trump’s calls, but offered an alternative explanation: The White House was trying to limit leaks of private conversations. CNN first reported on the White House effort.

The whistleblower is accusing Trump of using his office to “solicit interference from a foreign country” to help himself in next year’s U.S. election.

The call came days after Trump ordered a freeze to some military assistance for Ukraine, Trump prodded Zelenskiy to dig for potentially damaging material on Biden, the former vice president who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and volunteered the assistance of both his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and his attorney general, William Barr.

The White House has acknowledged that a record of that call was sealed away in a highly classified system at the direction of Trump’s National Security Council lawyers.

The former official noted that even some of Trump’s calls with American allies were restricted due to the classified matters that arise during the discussions.

After the disclosures about Trump’s calls to the Australian and Mexican leaders, a White House adviser raised the possibility of lie detector tests for the small number of people in the West Wing and elsewhere with access to transcripts of Trump’s phone calls.
